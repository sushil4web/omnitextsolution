            <b>My tutor warned us that he could find out if we bought a paper online. Is it true?
            <p>Ans: </b>
              College tutors and professors can track pre-written and recycled papers purchased (or even downloaded for free) by students from online paper databases. These papers are for many years and they are available to everyone who wants to view or buy them. They are like a so-called "Frat File." If you decide to purchase such a paper, be aware that many students have already submitted it. In this case, your tutor, using anti-plagiarism software will find out that your paper is plagiarized. Besides that, they can also Google the topic of your paper and find the whole work on the web.

            <b>What if I need a big assignment with allot of pages in a short period of time, why can I not make this order and why is this option blocked?
            <p>Ans: </b>
              We guarantee the quality of our writing and we know from experience that completing a big order times time to research and write. We have many solutions available to answer your writing needs and can provide you with nearly any paper, but some extra large orders can not be processed in our system. One solution for a large order like a dissertation is to place several orders for individual chapters. Please contact us if you have any questions.
